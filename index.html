  <h1 class="bio"> Biography </h1>
  <p> I am from Venezuela. I have been living out off the country since 2008. I have lived in Spain for 7 years, and then we moved to Mexico, where we lived for 2 years. Now, I am taking classes at CodeFellows because I feel that I need a fresh start. I am lawyer but I cannot practice in the United States, thus I took the opportunity that CodeFellows gave me. </p>

  <h2 class="random"> Facts about me </h2>
  <p>
    I can see my future as a crazy cat lady. Since I was a little girl, I've rescued animals from the street. I just stopped a little bit when I moved to Spain, and even there I rescued 2 cats. They are still with me. On the other hand, I enjoy being creative, sometimes it is frustraiting but at the end I feel happy when I can see and touch what I have created. I like to travel, since 2008 I have been traveling through Europe and Mexico. Now I am living here in Seattle, but who knows what would be next!
